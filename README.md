# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

This is a beginner-friendly Python tool that checks the strength of a password based on:

- Length (at least 8 characters)
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters

- Special characters

### 🧠 How it works

- **Weak**
- **Moderate**
- **Strong**

### ▶️ To Run:
1. Install Python if you haven't already
2. Save the script as `password_checker.py`
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
